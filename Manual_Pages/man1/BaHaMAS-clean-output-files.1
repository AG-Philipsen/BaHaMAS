BaHaMAS-clean-output-files - Check and if needed clean the measurement
file(s)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]BaHaMAS clean-output-files\f[R] [\f[I]option\f[R] \&...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Unless the \f[B]--all\f[R] option is given, the \f[B]betas\f[R] file is
parsed in order to gather information about on which folders it should
be acted (only uncommented lines are considered in this mode).
This mode operates exclusively on new-chains folders and in particular
on the simulation output files.
.PP
It can happen that a trajectory is continued and a bunch of trajectories
are then repeated.
This implies that these repeated trajectories appear more than once in
the output file(s) and this might lead to wrong analysis.
In this execution mode, BaHaMAS will go throught the output files and
clean them, keeping only the first occurence of each trajectory.
For safety reason, a backup of the output file is done and it is left in
the output file folder with a suffix constructed from the cleaning date.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B --all
All existing new-chain folders are considered and the \f[B]betas\f[R]
file is not parsed.
.TP
.B --betasfile \f[I]filename\f[R]
Use \f[I]filename\f[R] instead of \f[B]betas\f[R] file.
.SH FILES
.TP
.B ./betas
Only uncommented lines in the \f[B]betas\f[R] file are considered in
this mode.
