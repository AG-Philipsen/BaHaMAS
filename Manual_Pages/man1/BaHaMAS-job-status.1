BaHaMAS-job-status - Give overview of submitted jobs getting information
from scheduler
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]BaHaMAS job-status\f[R] [\f[I]option\f[R] \&...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Although each scheduler offers plenty of functionality to check enqueued
jobs, this BaHaMAS execution mode is an add-on to gather together the
main information the user might be interested in, producing a nice
report to the standard output.
.PP
Jobs with different status are displayed with different colors.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Red\f[R] is used if the submitted job is pending without that its
starting time is known.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Yellow\f[R] is used if the submitted job is pending and its
starting time is known.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Green\f[R] is used if the submitted job is running.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Magenta\f[R] is used for other status, e.g.\ when a job is in the
completing phase.
.PP
The report terminates with a numerical summary.
