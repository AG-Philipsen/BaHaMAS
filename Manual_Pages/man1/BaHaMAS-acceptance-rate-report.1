BaHaMAS-acceptance-rate-report - Produce a table with acceptance rates
in subsequent intervals
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]BaHaMAS acceptance-rate-report\f[R] [\f[I]option\f[R] \&...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]betas\f[R] file is parsed in order to gather information about
on which folders it should be acted (only uncommented lines are
considered in this mode).
This mode operates on the newest beta folders and in particular on the
simulation output files.
This means that if no new chain folder exist, a thermalization from conf
is considered and if this is also not existing, a thermalization from
hot is used.
.PP
Looking for the Metropolis test acceptance output, BaHaMAS calculates
and prints to the output a report in which the acceptance rates will be
summarized.
The interval width can be adjusted using the \f[B]--interval\f[R]
option.
Only the acceptance for complete intervals is calculated.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B --interval \f[I]number\f[R]
Specify how many trajectories should be considered to calculate the
acceptance rate.
.TP
.B --onlyFromHot
Only thermalizations from hot will be included in the acceptance rate
report.
.TP
.B --onlyFromConf
Only thermalizations from conf will be included in the acceptance rate
report.
.TP
.B --onlyNewChains
Only new chains will be included in the acceptance rate report.
.TP
.B --betasfile \f[I]filename\f[R]
Use \f[I]filename\f[R] instead of \f[B]betas\f[R] file.
.SH FILES
.TP
.B ./betas
Only uncommented lines in the \f[B]betas\f[R] file are considered in
this mode.
