BaHaMAS-continue-thermalization - Adjust input file(s) and resume
thermalization simulation(s)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]BaHaMAS continue-thermalization\f[R] [\f[I]option\f[R] \&...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]betas\f[R] file is parsed in order to gather information about
the simulations that should be continued (only uncommented lines are
considered in this mode).
This mode operates exclusively on thermalization jobs and it tries to
continue them.
.PP
Whether a thermalization \[lq]from hot\[rq] or a thermalization
\[lq]from conf\[rq] should be continued is determined based on the
existence of an already thermalized configuration from hot in the folder
of thermalized configurations.
\f[B]If at least one exists, then it is assumed that a thermalization
\[lq]from conf\[rq] is being done.\f[R] This might not be what the user
wants, though.
If e.g.\ a thermalization \[lq]from hot\[rq] is finished but one other
crashed and the user wishes to resume it, then the automatic mechanism
should be disabled.
This can be comfortably done using the \f[B]--fromHot\f[R] option.
.PP
The input file of each simulation is adjusted according to the option
passed and some sanity checks are performed.
The number of trajectories which will be done is determined as follows.
.IP \[bu] 2
If the \f[B]--measurements\f[R] option is given, then it will be used.
.IP \[bu] 2
Otherwise, if the \f[B]--till\f[R]\f[I]=number\f[R] option is given,
then it will be used.
.IP \[bu] 2
Otherwise, if the \f[B]g\f[R]\f[I]number\f[R] field is present in the
\f[B]betas\f[R] file, then it will be used.
.IP \[bu] 2
Otherwise, the measurement option in the input file is not modified.
.PP
To resume a simulation from a given trajectory, add a
\f[B]r\f[R]\f[I]number\f[R] field in the \f[B]betas\f[R] file.
Use \f[B]rlast\f[R] in the \f[B]betas\f[R] file to resume a simulation
from the last saved checkpoint.
If possible, based on the provided information, it is checked if each
simulation is finished and, if so, it is not continued and a message is
printed for the user.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B --till, -t \f[I]number\f[R]
Specify till which trajectory number the simulations should be
continued.
.TP
.B --betasfile \f[I]filename\f[R]
Use \f[I]filename\f[R] instead of \f[B]betas\f[R] file.
.TP
.B --fromHot
Force BaHaMAS to act on thermalization(s) from hot without determining
itself the thermalization type.
.TP
.B --measurements, -m \f[I]number\f[R]
Specify the number of trajectories that should be done (default: 1000).
.TP
.B --jobscript_prefix \f[I]string\f[R]
Specify the prefix of the jobscript file (default: own setup).
.TP
.B --walltime, -w \f[I]dd-hh:mm:ss\f[R] | \f[I]human-string\f[R]
Specify the simulation wall-time (default: own setup).
To specify e.g.\ one day, you can either use the standard form
\f[B]1-00:00:00\f[R] or a more handy \f[I]human-string\f[R], in the
example \f[B]1d\f[R].
Supported postfixes are \f[B]d\f[R] for days, \f[B]h\f[R] for hours,
\f[B]m\f[R] for minutes and \f[B]s\f[R] for seconds.
\f[B]1-12:06:30\f[R] is then equivalent to \f[B]1d12h6m30s\f[R].
.TP
.B --partition \f[I]string\f[R]
Specify on which partition the job should be submitted (default: own
setup).
For instance, for SLURM, this will use the \f[B]--partition\f[R] sbatch
directive.
.TP
.B --node \f[I]node-list\f[R]
Specify on which node(s) the job should be submitted (default: own
setup).
The \f[I]node-list\f[R] has to comply with the cluster specifications.
For instance, for SLURM, this will use the \f[B]--nodelist\f[R] sbatch
directive.
.TP
.B --constraint \f[I]string\f[R]
Specify a hardware constraint for the to-be-submitted jobs (default: own
setup).
The \f[I]string\f[R] has to comply with the cluster specifications.
For instance, for SLURM, this will use the \f[B]--gres\f[R] sbatch
directive.
.TP
.B --resource \f[I]string\f[R]
Specify a resource selection (default: own setup).
The \f[I]string\f[R] has to comply with the cluster specifications.
For instance, for SLURM, this will use the \f[B]--constraint\f[R] sbatch
directive.
.SH CL2QCD OPTIONS
.TP
.B --pf \f[I]number\f[R]
Specify how many pseudofermions should be used (default: 1).
.TP
.B --confSaveEvery, -F
Specify every how many trajectories the \f[B].save\f[R] checkpoint is
overwritten (default: 20).
.TP
.B --cgbs \f[I]number\f[R]
Specify the conjugate gradient block-size and namely every how many
iterations on the device the residuum is checked for convergence on the
host (default: 50).
.TP
.B --togglePbp
Invert logic value about measurement of the pbp specified by the user in
the setup.
.TP
.B --checkpointEvery, -f \f[I]number\f[R]
Specify every how many trajectories a check-point should be stored to
disk (default: 100).
.SH openQCD-FASTSUM OPTIONS
.TP
.B --coresPerNode
Specify how many nodes should be used per node (default: own setup).
.SH FILES
.TP
.B ./betas
Only uncommented lines in the \f[B]betas\f[R] file are considered in
this mode.
