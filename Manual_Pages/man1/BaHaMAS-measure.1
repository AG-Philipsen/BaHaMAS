.SH NAME
.PP
BaHaMAS-measure - Prepare what is needed and submit measurement job(s)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]BaHaMAS measure\f[R] [\f[I]option\f[R] \&...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]betas\f[R] file is parsed in order to gather information about
on which configuration sets it should be acted (only uncommented lines
are considered in this mode).
This mode operates exclusively on new-chains folders.
.PP
\f[B]CL2QCD\f[R] behaviour consists in calculating correlators on the
given configurations.
Running this mode e.g.\ on an unfinished beta folder will result in an
attempt to complete the calculation.
Said differently, already existing correlators will not be evaluated
agian.
.PP
\f[B]openQCD-FASTSUM\f[R] does not support this mode.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B --betasfile \f[I]filename\f[R]
Use \f[I]filename\f[R] instead of \f[B]betas\f[R] file.
.TP
.B --jobscript_prefix \f[I]string\f[R]
Specify the prefix of the jobscript file (default: own setup).
.TP
.B --walltime, -w \f[I]dd-hh:mm:ss\f[R] | \f[I]human-string\f[R]
Specify the simulation wall-time (default: own setup).
To specify e.g.\ one day, you can either use the standard form
\f[B]1-00:00:00\f[R] or a more handy \f[I]human-string\f[R], in the
example \f[B]1d\f[R].
Supported postfixes are \f[B]d\f[R] for days, \f[B]h\f[R] for hours,
\f[B]m\f[R] for minutes and \f[B]s\f[R] for seconds.
\f[B]1-12:06:30\f[R] is then equivalent to \f[B]1d12h6m30s\f[R].
.TP
.B --partition \f[I]string\f[R]
Specify on which partition the job should be submitted (default: own
setup).
For instance, for SLURM, this will use the \f[B]--partition\f[R] sbatch
directive.
.TP
.B --node \f[I]node-list\f[R]
Specify on which node(s) the job should be submitted (default: own
setup).
The \f[I]node-list\f[R] has to comply with the cluster specifications.
For instance, for SLURM, this will use the \f[B]--nodelist\f[R] sbatch
directive.
.TP
.B --constraint \f[I]string\f[R]
Specify a hardware constraint for the to-be-submitted jobs (default: own
setup).
The \f[I]string\f[R] has to comply with the cluster specifications.
For instance, for SLURM, this will use the \f[B]--gres\f[R] sbatch
directive.
.TP
.B --resource \f[I]string\f[R]
Specify a resource selection (default: own setup).
The \f[I]string\f[R] has to comply with the cluster specifications.
For instance, for SLURM, this will use the \f[B]--constraint\f[R] sbatch
directive.
.SH FILES
.TP
.B ./betas
Only uncommented lines in the \f[B]betas\f[R] file are considered in
this mode.
